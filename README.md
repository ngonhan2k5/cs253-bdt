# âœ´Tip to install Cloudera and Google Cloud (A replacement of VM images)

ðŸŒŸInstall docker and cloudera quickstart on Ubuntu

This is work for ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 LTS, if you didn't have ubuntu, try to get free account on G cloud and follow the ðŸŒŸCreate instance on google cloud (Image Tuts) in Wiki
sudo -i
## if this is the first time run, we need an update apt package meta
apt update
## install docker and docker-composer
apt-get install docker.io
apt-get install docker-compose
## buid and start docker
./start
## now you can use browser to access http://"External Ip" depending on where your Ubuntu node hosted

Notes: 
* If you want to get use of Cloudera Manager, you must run /home/cloudera/cloudera-manager after the docker first started and do a instance down and start again.
* If you want to update spark2 java8 and kafka pls down load and put /kafka /spark /java1.8xx in /ext/lib (see volumes in docker-compose.yml)
