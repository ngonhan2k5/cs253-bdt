# âœ´Tip to install Cloudera and Google Cloud (A replacement of VM images)

### ðŸŒŸInstall docker and cloudera quickstart on Ubuntu <a name="headin"></a>

This is work for ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 LTS, if you didn't have ubuntu, try to get free account on G cloud and follow the [ðŸŒŸCreate instance on google cloud (Image Tuts)](#headin2)

sudo -i
### if this is the first time run, we need an update apt package meta
apt update
### install docker and docker-composer
apt-get install docker.io
apt-get install docker-compose
### buid and start docker
./start
### now you can use browser to access http://"External Ip" depending on where your Ubuntu node hosted

## Notes: 
* If you want to get use of Cloudera Manager, you must run /home/cloudera/cloudera-manager after the docker first started and do a instance down and start again.
* If you want to update spark2 java8 and kafka pls download and put /kafka /spark /jdk1.8.0_202 in /ext/lib (see volumes in docker-compose.yml) and you may need to change /cloudera/profile file to match these foldername
